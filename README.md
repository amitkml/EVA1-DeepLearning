# Course : Extensive Vision AI (EVA #3)

Duration : 9 months* (I did for 1.2 years)

Syllabus : [Details](https://theschoolof.ai/#details)

Note: Syllabus changes in accordance with the update in reasearch and industry side . its like training a nerual network every batch is trained to achieve greater accuracy/generalization .
